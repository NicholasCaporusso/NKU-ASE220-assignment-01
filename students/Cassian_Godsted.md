### Summary
I'm primarily a web developer, but my work in the nonprofit and education spaces have given me opportunities to learn a variety of skills, including event management, scripting and automation, as well as basic electronics. I'm always willing to learn, and I pride myself on being driven to make my work a success.

I've been the Internal Systems Admin at INTERalliance for the last four years, and I manage their site and the website for TechOlympics, the largest student run tech conference in the US. While there, I also handled a full redesign of the website for the Carnegie.

I'm President of the Norse IoT club at Northern Kentucky University, where I study Computer Information Technology, and I work at NKU's College of Informatics handling day to day operations and events.

### Projects
#### INTERalliance Website Redesign - 2022
- In 2022, I led a team to redesign the website for the INTERalliance, giving the site a more modern design and fixing technical issues that accrued over the years.
- This project was based in Wordpress and used Elementor, with some custom HTML/CSS addons.

#### Website Workshops - 2023
- In 2023, I ran an event for the Norse IoT club to teach students the basics of HTML/CSS and showed them how to create their own personal resume sites. The sites would be hosted on free NKU-provided network drives.
- For this event, I built six template sites that I showed students how to edit. One challenge we ran into day of was that the network drives ended up crashing before the event started, so we had to pivot and use an alternate host for the sites, which ended up being GitHub Pages.
